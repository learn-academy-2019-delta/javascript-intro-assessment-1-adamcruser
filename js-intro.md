# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: a function is an equation you would plug your variable or object into.

  Researched answer:Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


2. What is a method?

  Your answer:A function inside of a class.

  Researched answer:JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.


3. List 5 examples of JavaScript string methods.

  Your answer:concat(), split(), splice(), toLowerCase(),join()

  Researched answer:charAt(),charCodeAt(),concat(),endsWith(),fromCharCode()


4. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer:join(), spit(), push() 

  Researched answer: pop(), push(), shift(), unshift(), .length


5. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Provide an example of each.

  Your answer: acessor methods change the object or variable temporarily and mutator changes them indefinetely. example of acessor method: var apple = apple { const apple= bannana (apple is still equal to apple after called back. example of mutator: var apple = apple { let apple = bannana (apple is now equal to bannana and is no longer equal to apple.)
  

  Researched answer:Accessor is a checker, but Mutator is a changer. ... In computer science, a mutator method is a method used to control changes to a variable. They are also widely known as setter methods. Often a setter is accompanied by a getter (also known as an accessor), which returns the value of the private member variable.  acessor ex:


6. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer:console log is what you see on your end(in your eyes), and return is what the computer sees(in the background)

  Researched answer:When using the return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value. console.log prints the string in firebug console. ... return just return from the function without processing further code or you can say, A function immediately stops at the point where return is called.


7. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: An argument is your variables declaration or the name of what you are going to make your variable equal too(can be anything). A variable is unique data or an object and an argument is the back end of a variable?.. 

  Researched answer:Arguments are Passed by Value. The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations.
  JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).


8. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: JavaScript is a language or code that allows a user to be able to click on a button such as home, settings, or message and actually have something happen. Without JavaScript those functions or buttons wouldn't do anything.  

  Researched answer:JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.


9. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer:Proper pair programming is the give and take of information between two individuals working on one computer and project. One person types while the other is directing or "Navigating" them through the task at hand then take a break and switch roles.
              
  Navigator and Operator are the two roles that play into proper pair programming.

  Researched answer:Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

10. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Working in groups with different individuals.

  Researched answer:N/A
